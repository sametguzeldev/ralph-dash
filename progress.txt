## Codebase Patterns
- No test framework configured — quality checks are typecheck + build (`npm run build` in frontend/)
- Frontend uses TanStack React Query with 5s refetch intervals for dashboard data
- Project summary counts come from backend API; frontend just displays them
- Tailwind CSS with custom `ralph` purple color palette

## 2026-02-21 - US-004
- Updated ProjectCard summary text from "X/Y done" to "X done · Y in progress · Z pending" three-state format
- Files changed: `frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ProjectCard component is in `frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx` (not a separate component file)
  - `inProgressStories` field was already added to `ProjectSummary` in US-002/US-003, so the frontend type was ready
  - Pending count is derived: `totalStories - doneStories - inProgressStories`

## 2026-02-23 - US-001
- Added git config API endpoints to `backend/src/routes/settings.ts`
- GET /api/settings now includes `gitConfigured`, `gitUserName`, `gitUserEmail` when `isDocker` is true
- PUT /api/settings/git-config validates name (non-empty) and email (contains @ with text on both sides), stores as `gitUserName`/`gitUserEmail`
- DELETE /api/settings/git-config removes both keys and returns `{ success: true }`
- Files changed: `backend/src/routes/settings.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `tsc` is not globally available — use `backend/node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p backend/tsconfig.json` for typechecks
  - devDependencies may not be installed; run `npm install --include=dev` in backend/ first
  - Settings route pattern: `db.prepare('INSERT OR REPLACE INTO settings (key, value) VALUES (?, ?)').run(key, value)`
  - Docker-only fields are conditionally added to the response object using `if (isDocker)`
