## 2026-02-21 22:04 - Parallel wave: US-001,US-002
- Stories ran in parallel worktrees via `claude --worktree`
---

## 2026-02-21 - US-003
- Added `inProgressStories` count to GET /api/projects endpoint (counts stories where inProgress is true and passes is not true)
- Verified deriveTaskStatus call sites in /:id/status and /:id/archives/:folder already use single-argument signature
- Verified progress data is still parsed and returned in API responses
- Files changed: `backend/src/routes/projects.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-001 and US-002 already updated deriveTaskStatus to single-argument form and updated frontend types — US-003 only needed the inProgressStories count added to the projects list endpoint
  - The projects list endpoint enriches DB rows with filesystem-derived data (prd, branch, run status) in a `.map()` call
