## 2026-02-27 - US-003
- Injected `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` into spawn env in `skillRunner.ts` when `autoMemoryEnabled` is false in DB
- Used guard pattern: only inject if not already set in `cleanEnv` (matching the pattern from processManager.ts)
- Reads `autoMemoryEnabled` from DB settings table; defaults to true when not set
- Files changed: `backend/src/services/skillRunner.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - skillRunner.ts uses `cleanEnv` (vs `runEnv` in processManager.ts) — same guard pattern applies
  - Injection block goes after model injection, before `spawn()` call
  - Frontend rollup native module (`@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64`) is missing — use `tsc -b --noEmit` directly instead of `npm run build` for frontend typecheck

## 2026-02-27 - US-002
- Injected `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` into spawn env in `processManager.ts` when `autoMemoryEnabled` is false in DB
- Used guard pattern: only inject if not already set in `runEnv` (same guard as other env vars in this file)
- Reads `autoMemoryEnabled` from DB settings table; defaults to true when not set
- Files changed: `backend/src/services/processManager.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The env injection block in processManager.ts follows a consistent pattern: read from DB, check guard condition, assign to `runEnv`
  - Deserialization pattern: `autoMemoryRow ? autoMemoryRow.value === 'true' : true` (same as settings.ts)
  - The guard check uses `!runEnv.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY` (not `process.env`) since `runEnv` starts as a spread of `process.env`

## 2026-02-27 - US-001
- Added `autoMemoryEnabled` field to GET /api/settings (reads from DB, defaults to true)
- Added PUT /api/settings/auto-memory to save boolean toggle to settings table
- Added DELETE /api/settings/auto-memory to remove the setting from DB
- Files changed: backend/src/routes/settings.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Settings are stored as string values in the key-value `settings` table; booleans must be serialized with `String()` and deserialized with `=== 'true'`
  - The GET /api/settings handler pattern: query each key individually, build response object, return res.json
  - isDocker guard for optional fields is only used for git-config fields
